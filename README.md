An easy way to collaborate on and edit AWS DynamoDB tables First, a serverless API for dynamodb must be created, which takes under 10 minutes. Look at https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-rest-api-with-dynamodb for reference. The ids (columns) must be specified in ids file and the api you created must be specified inside the index.js inside the actions folder. Then, you can edit your dynamodb tables very easily!
